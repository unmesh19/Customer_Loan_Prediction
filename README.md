## Customer Loon Prediction Project Readme

In the regim of financial services, the ability to accurately predict toon defouits is of paramount importance. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to Forecast whether a customer will default on a loan, based on various factors including credit history and demographic information

## Dataset

The project utilizes two key datasets

**Customer_Loon_Prediction_Train Esv** This dataset comprises b14 meticulously curated

customer records, encompassing crucial attributes such as gender, marital status, income details, loan parameters, credit history, and properby area.

**Customer Loan Prediction_Fest.csv** Serving as the evaluation ground, this daboent contains 367 records mirroring the structure of the braining set, but without the target variable (default status).

## Algorithm and Model Evaluation

The heart of the project lies in the development of a sophisticated machine learning algorithm, meticulously crafted within the Customer Loan Prediction.ipynb Key highlights include Jupyter Notebook bitied

- Utilization of pandas and scikit-learn libraries for data processing and model development. -Fine-tuning of hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

- Evaluation of multiple classifiers including logistic regression, multinomial Naive Bayes, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes

- Selection of the Bernoulli Noove Bayes model as the top performer, achieving on impressive accuracy of **79.6796**

## Predictions

Armed with the optimized algorithm, predictions were made on the test datoset The outcome of this predictive journey resulbed in the creation of a new File named Customer Loan Prediction_Test_Final es, housing the forecasted target variable for each customer record

## Analysis

A comprehensive analysis of the train datoent was conducted to unravel insights into the

Factors influencing loan approval likelihood key components of this analysis include: -In-depth exploration of various features using pondos and visualization tools

- Unearthing valuable insights into the relationships between different attributes and loon defouit likelihood

## Additional Files

**Customer_Loan_Prediction_Test.ssy** The best dataset without output, utilized For

predictive modeling **Customer_Loon_Prediction_Fraincsy** The cornerstone of the project, providing

data for algorithm development and analysis. **Customer_Loon_Prediction_Test_Final.esy** The output file containing predicted

defouits generated by the algorithm

This project represents a comprehensive approach to predictive modeling in the domain of

toon defouit prediction, combining technical expertise with a deep understanding of the

underlying data to deliver actionable insights.
